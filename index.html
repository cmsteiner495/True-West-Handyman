He's a consummate professional...he showed up when he said he would, let us know if he was running late (which was rare), and stayed to work the whole day, as opposed to running from job to job. He was very clean while working, and treated our home like a home. Not to mention, the quality of his work was outstanding! Everything from drywall repair to painting to other random fixes, Dustin was great! We were on a tight timeline, revamping our home before moving, and there were a lot of different things to be done. He did everything on time or ahead of schedule, his prices were fantastic, and the overall experience was the best I've ever had with a contractor, handyman, etc. (though those terms don't do him justice at all)! I highly, highly recommend Dustin for everything from small jobs to big jobs!">
