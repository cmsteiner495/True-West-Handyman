Everything from drywall repair to painting to other random fixes, Dustin was great! We were on a tight timeline, revamping our home before moving, and there were a lot of different things to be done. He did everything on time or ahead of schedule, his prices were fantastic, and the overall experience was the best I've ever had with a contractor, handyman, etc. (though those terms don't do him justice at all)!
